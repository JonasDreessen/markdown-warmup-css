    <h2></h2>Why did they build it?</h2>

    <p>
      Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a <i>source code editor</i>
      <br />
      with powerful developer tooling, like IntelliSense code completion and
      debugging.

      <b>First and foremost</b>, it is an editor that gets out of your way.<br />
      The delightfully frictionless edit-build-debug cycle means less time
      fiddling with your environment, and more time executing on your ideas.
    </p>

    <h2>On what system does it run?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>macOS</li>
      <li>Windows</li>
      <li>Linux</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Personalization and plugins</h2>
    <q
      >Customize every feature to your liking and install any number of
      third-party extensions.</q
    >
    <br />
    <p>
      While most scenarios work "out of the box" with no configuration, VS Code
      also grows with you, optimize your experience to suit your unique needs.
      <br />
      VS Code is an open source project so you can also contribute to the
      growing and vibrant community on GitHub. ps: most used plugins are all
      free

    <!-- Section about Brackets-->

    <h1>3. Brackets</h1>
    <img src="screenshot5.png"/><br />
    <img src="screenshot6.png"/>

    <h2>Why use Brackets?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Brackets is a lightweight, yet powerful, modern text editor. They blend
        visual tools into the editor so you get the right amount of help when
        you want it without getting in the way of your creative process.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Live Preview</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        get a real-time connection to your browser. Make changes to CSS and html
        and you'll instantly see those changes on screen. Also see where your
        CSS selector is being applied in the browser by simply putting your
        cursor on it.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Inline Editors</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Instead of jumping between file tabs, Brackets lets you open a window
        into the code you care about most. Want to work on the CSS that applies
        to a specific ID? Put your mouse cursor on that ID, push Command /
        Ctrl+E and Brackets will show you all the CSS selectors with that ID in
        an inline window so you can work on your code side-by-side without any
        popups.
      </li>
    </ul>
